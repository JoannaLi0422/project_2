            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>This website turns sound into a visual pattern. It doesn't care what you say. It only listens to how loud or quiet you are. Loud sounds make the line move more. Quiet sounds make smaller movements. Silence makes dashed lines. The pattern grows in a spiral from the center.</p>

            <h1>How does it work?</h1>
            <p>When you click the orange circle, the website listens through your microphone. It measures the volume of any sound it hears. Then it uses simple rules to draw:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Loud sound = the line moves more</li>
                <li>Soft sound = smaller movements</li>
                <li>No sound = dashed line</li>
                <li>The line keeps growing outward in a spiral</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The rules control the shape, but your sounds control how it looks. Every pattern is different because every person sounds different.</p>

            <h1>What should I do?</h1>
            <p>Make any sound you want. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Talk about anything</li>
                <li>Count numbers</li>
                <li>Sing a song</li>
                <li>Hum or whistle</li>
                <li>Clap your hands</li>
                <li>Play music near the microphone</li>
                <li>Make random noises</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It doesn't matter what sounds you make. The website just listens to the volume and rhythm. You can use any language. You can be loud or quiet. You can pause by clicking the orange circle, then click it again to continue.</p>

            <h1>What questions does this raise?</h1>

            <h2>About listening:</h2>
            <p>When technology listens to us, what does it hear? This project shows you exactly what it captures. You can see that it only measures volume, nothing else. But many apps and devices listen without telling us what they record or how they use it.</p>

            <h2>About voices:</h2>
            <p>This system treats all sounds equally. Loud, soft, accented, or musical. It doesn't judge if your voice is "correct" or not. But many voice technologies only work well for certain types of voices. What happens to people whose voices the technology can't understand?</p>

            <h2>About privacy:</h2>
            <p>Your sounds never leave your computer. Nothing gets saved or sent anywhere. When you close this page, the pattern disappears forever. This is a choice about privacy. What if all listening technology worked this way?</p>

            <h2>About the body:</h2>
            <p>Speaking takes effort. You need breath and energy. When you run out of breath, you pause. When you feel excited, you get louder. The pattern shows these physical moments. It makes visible something that is usually invisible: the body behind the voice.</p>

            <h1>Why make this?</h1>
            <p>This project comes from research about pattern and chaos. Living things constantly balance between order and disorder. Your voice does this too. It has rhythm and structure, but also pauses and changes. The pattern you create captures this balance. It shows that chaos and control can exist together.</p>
